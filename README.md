## Rend Origin

A 1.21.1 Minecraft datapack adding a custom origin for use with the Origins mod. It is intended to provide a polished and fully furnished experience, but drastically alter how you approach the game.

This is currently in development and not recommend for use. Multiple Rend should be able to exist in a world without issue.

### Dependencies

This is a 1.21.1 datapack made for Origins 1.13.0 alpha 12. It is unlikely to function with older versions of Minecraft or Origins!

A custom resource pack is highly recommended and will be linked here once complete.

### Important Notes

If a Fallen Tether Doll has not placed correctly, attempting to place another at the same location will fix this. Currently, successfully placed dolls will revert to items after 1 minute due to performance concerns.

### Lore

A specialised subclass of an ancient race. Not excelling in physical strength
but making up for it in agility and their unique ability to
control the flow of mana. Compared to their stronger kin, even
fewer of them have managed to survive the millenia of
entombment. Those who have are exceedingly weak, making the
chances of them ever escaping the hell they created near-insurmountable.

### Gameplay

Especially when starting out, this is a difficult origin to play! Your XP level is an important mechanic which determines your strength and affects many of your abilities. Hence, dying can be _very_ detrimental! Not all is woeful, however: abilities can be obtained later as you progress and explore.
