### Important Notes

Minor issues may arise if more than one Rend is present in a world due to some calculations using global storage.

After switching to another origin, run `/function rend:remove_all_modifiers` to remove attribute modifiers set by this origin.

### Lore

An elite subclass of an ancient race. Not excelling in physical strength
but making up for it in agility and their unique ability to
control the flow of mana. Compared to their stronger kin, even
fewer of them have managed to survive the millenia of
entombment. Those who have are exceedingly weak, making the
chances of them ever escaping the hell they created near-
insurmountable.
